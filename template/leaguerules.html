<h1 id="L0.00">L0.00 - Overview</h1>
<h2 id="L0.01">L0.01 - Summary</h2>
<p>Seattle Monday Night Pinball (generally referred to as just MNP) is a
  co-ed adult (21+) team league where each team has a host venue (such as
  a barcade or any other venue that has pinball and serves alcohol), 
  which serves as the team's "home." Once a week for the duration of the 
  season, each team will compete against another team in their league, 
  either at "home" or as the visiting team at their opponent's home venue.
  Each team will score match points based on the results of the 
  individual pinball games. At the end of each match, the team with the 
  most points will record a win, while the other team will record a loss; a
  match may also end in a tie, which will record a tie for each team.  
  League standings are determined based on a simple win/loss/tie record 
  with cumulative match points as the main tiebreaker.</p>
<h2 id="L0.02">L0.02 - MNP Mission</h2>
<p>The mission of Seattle Monday Night Pinball is to provide the
  logistics needed to run a team league that allows pinball enthusiasts 
  from the Seattle metropolitan area to meet each other at the major 
  pinball venues within the area, through structured matches that have 
  teams compete against each other for friendly competition.</p>
<h2 id="L0.03">L0.03 - MNP Scope</h2>
<p>L0.03.0: MNP is about pinball and more specifically, the pinball 
  league. ONLY Pinball. There have been some misconceptions that MNP is a 
  large organization with influence among the various venues in the city. 
  That is not the case. MNP is neither a non-profit organization nor a 
  corporation. Rather, it is simply a group of players who form the MNP 
  Board, and volunteer their time to produce and manage the logistics 
  needed to make the league happen. This includes creating and managing 
  rules, producing the schedule each season, maintaining the software, and
  ensuring adequate communication among all the captains and players to 
  coordinate a distributed league.</p>

<p>L0.03.1: MNP is open to all players regardless of an individual’s 
  gender bias, social beliefs, political affiliations, mental or physical 
  disabilities, or background. The requirements to play are that a person 
  is over 21 and interested in pinball.</p>

<ul>
  <li>L0.03.1a: MNP is open to all players 21+. Nobody
    under 21 is allowed to play in the league, even if a venue is all ages.
    Captains who knowingly use under-age players are subject to disciplinary
    action (such as suspension or removal of captain duties). If an underage
    player has been found to play, they risk disciplinary action from the
    league and might not be able to join once they do become 21. If it is
    discovered that a player is under-age during a league night, then all
    their scores for that night will be converted to disqualifications. 
  </li>
</ul>

<p>L0.03.2: As such, MNP will not take a stand for or against any issue 
  that isn’t directly related to pinball, even when called upon in social 
  media. Generally those calls will go unanswered. Any individual that is a
  member of MNP is welcome to express their personal views publicly, but 
  all such expressions remain the view of the individual and do not 
  represent the views of MNP, because MNP is not an entity or organization
  and as such, does not possess views on any social or political issues. </p>

<p>L0.03.3: The one exception where MNP does take a stand is with 
  regards to the safety of players on league night. Any player that 
  harasses, threatens, assaults, or in any other way poses an active 
  safety risk to other players does risk being suspended or banned from 
  the league. Note that this applies directly to the individual’s conduct 
  during league night and at the league’s pinball venues in general on 
  other nights. MNP does not do background checks on members or venues, 
  and as such cannot guarantee the safety of every person in the league. 
  But if a safety issue is observed and a complaint is filed, then those 
  issues will be reviewed by the board. MNP does not have the resources to
  investigate any such safety issues that happen outside the scope of the
  pinball venues served by MNP, and will not take any action against 
  individuals accused if those individuals have not posed any threat or 
  safety risk to MNP players. Rather, such issues should be addressed 
  directly with venues or through the legal system for very serious 
  matters. </p>

<p>L0.03.4: There has also been a misconception that MNP can tell venues
  what to do. MNP has no authority to impose any restrictions on venues. 
  Furthermore, it is not MNP board that chooses a venue. Rather, captains 
  and their team choose the venue. MNP simply approves the use if they 
  meet the minimum league requirements such as number and quality of 
  pinball machines and open hours.  If an individual or team has an issue 
  with a venue, those issues should be taken up directly with the captain 
  who selected the venue, or with management or ownership of that venue. 
  MNP does not have the resources to serve as council, as the board does 
  not include any lawyers nor experts to deal with such conflicts.</p>

<p>L0.03.5: By playing in the league, whether as a roster player or sub,
  you are agreeing to all official decisions and all rules as describe
  herein and in the Match Rules. Failure to abide by the rules and
  decisions could lead to suspension or expulsion from the league. If the
  terms of the league are not agreeable, you should opt to not play in
  MNP.</p>

<p>L0.03.6: By choosing to be captain or co-captain, you are agreeing to
  enforce all official decisions and all rules as described herein and in
  the Match Rules. Failure to abide by the rules and decisions is a
  captain code-of-conduct violation and could lead to suspension or
  expulsion from the league. The lone exception is M5.01.1 for malfunction
  rulings only.</p>

<p>L0.03.7: Any issue brought to the MNP Board in writing (such as email
  or text directly to one or more board members) will be investigated.
  The MNP board will do what it can to understand all sides of any issue
  before issuing a decision, and will provide a decision that takes into
  consideration both majority opinion and what is best for the success of
  MNP.</p>

<p>L0.03.8: Captains who do not agree with a board decision have one
  appeal avenue. They may bring up their objection to the MNP Captains
  Group and create a poll. If captains representing more than half of the
  teams in the league disagree with the decision, the ruling will be
  reconsidered. Otherwise, the decision is final and players and captains
  are required to abide by such decisions or be subjected to code of
  conduct violations.</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Bar: </b>See Venue. &nbsp;These terms are used interchangeably.</li>
  <li><b>Expansion Team: </b>A new team to the league, or an existing team with significant roster changes.</li>
  <li><b>Game: </b>A game is played on a machine (see Machine below).</li>
  <li><b>IPR: </b>Individual Player Rating is a numeric, whole number, 
    value from 1 to 6. &nbsp;This number is a representation of a player’s 
    pinball skill, over a period of time. &nbsp;Skilled players have a

  <li><b>Location: </b>See Venue below</li>
  <li><b>Machine (Physical Machine / Machine-Ruleset): </b>A machine is a physical pinball machine (NOT to be
    referred to as a game). &nbsp;A machine doesn’t have a score; a game has a score. 
    Some physical pinball machines have multiple rulesets / multiple ways to play. To this end, each ruleset
    shall be treated as a separate machine (AKA machine-ruleset).</li>
  <li><b>Machine-Ruleset: </b>Some physical machines have an option to play different rulesets.
    In many places within the rules, a machine should be interpreted as machine-ruleset (each ruleset
    being listed as a separate machine). Example: 'Judge Dredd SuperGame' is a separate machine-ruleset than
    'Judge Dredd'; 'Bride of Pinbot 2.0' is a separate machine-ruleset than 'Bride of Pinbot'; 'FunHouse Rudy's
    Nightmare' is a separate machine-ruleset than 'FunHouse'.</span></li>
  <li><b>Match: </b>A competition between two Monday Night Pinball teams, the details of which are outlined
    in <a href="https://www.mondaynightpinball.com/matchrules">Match Rules for Monday Night Pinball</a>.</li>

  <li><b>MNP: </b>Monday Night Pinball</li>
  <li><b>Physical Machine: </b>This refers to the physical pinball hardware. This is in contrast to
  a machine-ruleset.</li>
  <li><b>Player: </b>Within the context of a match: a player is a person designated to participate in the
    match. &nbsp;Outside the context of a match: a player is a person eligible to participate in a Monday
    Night Pinball match.</li>
  <li><b>Roster: </b>A team’s registered members.</li>
  <li><b>Round: </b>A match occurs as a series of 4 rounds: two singles rounds, two doubles rounds.</li>
  <li><b>Ruleset: </b>Most physical machines have a single way to play: press start and play the game. But some
    physical machines have multiple ways of starting a game, allowing the player to play a different variation,
    and sometimes a completely different experience. Each different ways to play is referred to as a ruleset.</li>
  <li><b>Schedule: </b>A season’s published matches</li>
  <li><b>Sub / Substitute: </b>A person listed on a team’s lineup, but not currently on the team’s roster.</li>
  <li><b>Team Rating: </b>The sum of each roster player’s IPR. &nbsp;In the context of a match - the sum of each player’s IPR on the lineup.</li>

    one of the MNP Commissioners helping with a match ruling.</li>
  <li><b>Venue: </b>A location, meeting all of the league’s requirements to host an MNP match.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="L1.00">L1.00 - Venue</h1>
<p>L1.00.0: Each team in the league has a home venue. The venue must meet the requirements listed in this section.</p>
<h2 id="L1.01">L1.01 - Requirements</h2>
<p>L1.01.0: Venue must have a minimum of 8 machines (8 physical machines) in league-worthy condition. See information below on description of <a href="#L1.02">league-worthy</a>.</p>
<p>L1.01.1: A venue may only host one expansion team in their first season.</p>
<p>L1.01.2: A newly opening venue must already be open by the 
  application deadline date. If not, the expansion team request needs to 
  be for an alternate location that is capable of hosting the team, but 
  they can specify their interest to move to the new location when it 
  opens.</p>
<p>L1.01.3: The pinball area at the venue must be big enough to accommodate at least 24 players (20 players
  plus a few guests).</p>
<p>L1.01.4: No cover charge for venue. Players are expected to pay for
  play, but should not need to pay anything beyond that. An exception 
  is if cover charge is $5 or less per person and all machines are on free
  play, on both league nights and when players go to practice.</p>
<p>L1.01.5: Venue must sell at least beer or wine (i.e. must have liquor
  license). This is a barcade league, not a family league!</p>
<p>L1.01.6: Venue must be open (or willing to stay open) until at 
  least midnight on league nights. If they normally close before midnight,
  they must be willing to stay open on league nights until the end of the
  match.</p>
<p>L1.01.7: Venue must be within 20 miles of "Seattle". The
  geolocation of "Seattle" is defined as the Seattle Public
  Library, located at 5th and Madison.</p>
<h2 id="L1.02">L1.02 - League Worthiness of Machines</h2>
<p>L1.02.0: A machine is league-worthy if it meets the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
  <li>L1.02.0a: Machine is primarily pinball. A machine with a video 
    mode is OK, but a machine in which more than 10% of the time is in video
    mode, or for which you can lose your turn by losing video mode instead 
    of draining a ball, are not eligible.</li>
  <li>L1.02.0b: All switches are registering (it’s ok if one switch is 
    not registering but is not crucial to game play that nobody really 
    complains about it). Shots or features not working but have suitable 
    compensation enabled (like disabling claw in Demolition Man) is 
    acceptable.</li>
  <li>L1.02.0c: Lower flippers are strong enough to hit every shot, even
    after the machine has been in constant use for 30 minutes. Upper 
    flippers are strong enough to make crucial shots (a broken upper flipper
    on some games like Mars Trek is acceptable, but on most games it 
    isn’t).</li>
  <li>L1.02.0d: Most (preferably all) lights are working. Key lights are all working.</li>
  <li>L1.02.0e: Playfield is reasonably clean, and doesn’t have a year of grime build-up.</li>
  <li>L1.02.0f: Balls rarely get stuck.</li>
  <li>L1.02.0g: Machine does not regularly glitch, such as resetting 
    mid-game, ending balls prematurely, creating arbitrary multi-balls or 
    not serving multiple balls during multi-ball, etc. A machine that does 
    this rarely (e.g. at most once a day) is ok; if it happens in that case,
    malfunction rules apply. If it’s happening more frequently, the machine
    is not league worthy.</li>
</ul>

<p class="newrule">L1.02.1: All machines that are potentially league-worthy and
  intended for use on league should be posted on the Venue’s page on the website.
  If a machine is missing from the venue’s page and the opposing team does not want
  to use that machine, then it remains out for the night.  
</p>
<ul>
  <li class="newrule">L1.02.1a: Machines missing from the venue list but both teams
    agree to use it can be added at on league night.</li>
</ul>

<p class="newrule">L1.02.2: On league night, the captains from both teams should
  discuss and remove from use any machine that is not league worthy.</p>
<ul>
  <li class="newrule">L1.02.2a: Any machine that is powered OFF by the venue
    should be removed from use, even if both teams want to use it. Any machine
    that is powered off, but not by the venue (sometimes disgruntled players will
    turn off a machine) can be powered ON and evaluated, and if it appears to be
    league worthy, can be used.</li>
  <li class="newrule">L1.02.2b: Any machine that is powered ON and both captains
    agree to use it, is available for use.</li>
  <li class="newrule">L1.02.2c: Any machine that is powered ON and neither
    captain wants to use it for any reason, then it should be deleted from
    available machines once established the machine should not be used.</li>
</ul>
  
<p class="newrule">L1.02.3: If a machine is powered ON but captains from the two
  teams disagree on whether or not to include it, then refer to the following board’s
  guidance, where decision on IN or OUT depends on the reason, and special rules to
  apply should the issue occur during a league game. (Remember, any of this guidance
  should be overridden if captains from both teams agree). This is a reminder that if
  a team (especially the home team) does not like the fact that a machine is out due
  to one of the rules here, then contact your operator to maintain the machine. Just
  because a machine is used one week does not mean it is used the next week if the
  opposing captains have a different sentiment.</p>
<ul>
  <li class="newrule">L1.02.3a: The machine sometimes resets. Leave machine IN. If the
    reset occurs just once during the night, then follow catastrophic malfunction rules
    for that game, and remove it from use for remainder of evening.                                                                                                                                                                                     </li>
  <li class="newrule">L1.02.3b: A key switch or feature is not working. Such a switch is
    key if it is necessary to start a mode, complete a mode, start a non-wizard-mode
    multiball, or reach and score the super jackpot for a multiball. In this case,
    take machine OUT.</li>
  <li class="newrule">L1.02.3c: A minor switch or feature is not working. Such
     a switch is like a standup that might enable passive features like pop
      bumpers, spinners, standups, or drop targets that don’t meet the key
       switch definition from above. In this case, leave machine IN, play as-is.</li>
  <li class="newrule">L1.02.3d: Many lights are not working. If the non-working
     lights are for key features (like modes) and necessary to help the user
      determine progress in the game, take machine OUT. If the non-working lights
       are minor (like bonus, whether or not a minor feature like super-spinner is
        lit, etc.) then leave machine IN.</li>
  <li class="newrule">L1.02.3e: Ball sometimes gets stuck. Leave IN and apply stuck
     ball rules. If a stuck ball occurs during Multiball, then player needs to trap 
     up and stuck ball removed per IFPA rules. If keys are not available and it
     happens during Multiball, then the player can continue to play until only one
     not-stuck balls is left (the stuck ball(s) and one other ball). They must drain
     the non-stuck ball and let the ball search kick in. If the ball search does not
     free them and they need to tilt to get the ball out, then one compensation ball.</li>
  <li class="newrule">L1.02.3f: Carry-over Jackpot. The machine has a carry-over Jackpot
    feature from player to player that is deemed unfair. Leave machine IN, as MNP is
    just for fun and does not require machines to be in competition mode and
    randomness of features is just part of the game; you’ll win some and you’ll
    lose some.</li>
  <li class="newrule">L1.02.3g: The machine sometimes provides a second ball
    during single-ball play. If simply draining one ball does not cause the
    machine to lose count of the game, then Leave machine IN, but if this
    occurs player is to drain the extra ball immediately. If draining one ball
    ends the ball in play, or if during play the machine loses count on number
    of balls and does end ball prematurely, treat as a major malfunction. That
    is, issue compensation ball if it just happens once but abort game and
    start on a different machine if it happens twice in same game. In this
    latter case, also do not use that machine for any subsequent round. If
    during play this occurs and it becomes not possible to tell if the player
    is legitimately in multiball or not, play on as though in multiball, but do
    not use the machine in any subsequent round.</li>
  <li class="newrule">L1.02.3h: Machine sometimes moves to next player in
    middle of ball. Leave machine IN. If this happens in one game during a
    league game, abort the game as a catastrophic malfunction and pick a
    different machine. Don’t use the machine anymore for the night.</li>
  <li class="newrule">L1.02.3i: An upper flipper is not working. If every
    key shot is reachable by the lower flippers (e.g. Beatles, Wizard), then
    Leave Machine IN. If one or more key shots can only be made with the
    flipper that is broken, then take machine OUT (e.g. Addams Family, Stern
    Trek). </li>
  <li class="newrule">L1.02.3j: Weak flippers. If it can be demonstrated
    that every shot can be made even just once during a practice game, then
    Leave Machine IN. If team or individual who wants the machine to stay IN
    cannot demonstrate in a practice game that they can hit a particular shot,
    then Take machine OUT. This could be reevaluated between games if needed
    to account for flippers that get weaker as the machine gets played more.</li>
  <li class="newrule">L1.02.3k: Sticky flippers. If either or both flippers
    stick such that when you release them, it takes more than half-second for
    the flipper to react, then Take machine OUT. Some machines will stick but
    if you press the other flipper it unsticks. In this case, also Take machine
    OUT.</li>
  <li class="newrule">L1.02.3l: Machines gives free points. If the free points
    are only at start of ball or side-effect of something mechanical on
    playfield that only happens occasionally, like resetting drop targets and
    one falls back down providing points, then Leave Machine IN. If the free
    points occur from flipping or nudging and no other playfield action, then
    Take machine OUT, regardless of how insignificant the points might seem.</li>
  <li class="newrule">L1.02.3m: Display Issues Modern Machines. If an LED or
    Dot Matrix display is partially malfunction, but scores for both players
    can still be read unambiguously at least between balls and at end of game,
    then Leave Machine In.  Otherwise take the machine out. </li>
  <li class="newrule">L1.02.3n: Display Issues Classic Machines. If a Solid
    State or EM with separate scores for each player, then leave it IN if at
    least one score is fully working. If necessary, the machine can be played
    as a single player game, or if at least 2 displays or reels are working,
    then a 4-player match can be played as two 2-player games. If necessary,
    players must pay for the extra games and plunge through skipped player
    positions. On a Solid State machine If a single digit is missing or
    ambiguous, or one digit reel of an EM machine is broken, and it is one
    of the two lowest significant digits (excluding last digit of 0), then
    that display position can still be used and use a score of ‘5’ for that
    digit. If a different digit is broken, then that player position should
    be skipped.</li>
  <li class="newrule">L1.02.3o: Other Reasons. If another reason is being
    considered that is not covered above, you may attempt to contact a board
    member (Dave Stewart or Stephen Rakonza). They will make a decision and
    that decision will be binding. If you don’t hear back from them in a
    timely manner, then flip a coin for who gets to choose IN or OUT. If that
    machine is chosen to be IN but during course of a game has any major or
    catastrophic malfunction, then apply the rules per the rule sheet, and
    leave the game OUT for subsequent rounds.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="L1.03">L1.03 - New Venues</h2>
<p>L1.03.0: A new venue will be evaluated for possible play upon request
  to the MNP Board. A board member will visit the venue and approve if it
  meets the Venue requirements.</p>

<p>L1.03.1: Once a venue is approved, a team can list that venue as 
  their choice for home venue six weeks prior to a season. That venue can 
  also be used as a backup location if an existing venue fails to have at 
  least five working machines.</p>

<p>L1.03.2: If a new venue is not yet open six weeks prior to start of 
  season, then the team must pick a different venue as their home, and 
  make a request to move to the new venue once it is approved. If such a 
  request is not made prior to the season start, then the team will need 
  to wait until the following season to move to that venue.</p>

<p>L1.03.3: A venue may only host one expansion team in their first 
  season (restating L1.01.2).</p>
  
<h1 id="L2.00">L2.00 - Team</h1>
<p>L2.00.0: Teams consist of at least 8 roster players, and no more than
  10. &nbsp;Of these, one player will act as the Team Captain. A second 
  player must be named as a co-captain. A team can hold up to two unfilled
  positions and use subs until a suitable new roster player is found.</p>

<p>L2.00.1: The team must have a designated venue, which shall host the 
  “home” matches. &nbsp;At least six weeks prior to start of a season, per
  published deadlines, both returning teams and expansion teams must 
  declare their home venue. Exception: A team that
  had a home venue, but venue closed or no longer league suitable, can play
  the remainder of the current season and through the end of the following
  season before finding a new home venue. While a team has no home venue, M1.01
  (see <a href="https://www.mondaynightpinball.com/matchrules#M1.01">Match Rules for Monday Night Pinball</a>)
  shall apply for selecting an alternate venue.</p>

<h2 id="L2.01">L2.01 - Captains</h2>
<p>L2.01.0: The team’s Captain and Co-Captain are collectively referred 
  to as the team’s Captains. &nbsp;Captains are responsible for organizing
  their team and corresponding promptly with the league about rosters, 
  scoring and scheduling. Captains also serve as team representatives in 
  each of the matches.</p>

<p>L2.01.1: The captains must meet the following requirements.</p>
<ul>
  <li>L2.01.1a: Captain and co-captain must each have already played in at least one full season in MNP.</li>
  <li>L2.01.1b: Captains and co-captains should have a Facebook account,
    and must be part of the Facebook Monday Night Pinball Captains group, 
    as that is how communication with captains from the league occurs. 
    Alternately, a captain may designate a proxy with a Facebook account, to
    handle correspondence with league officials. &nbsp;Captains without a 
    Facebook account must supply the MNP Board with a contact email address 
    and a phone number where they can accept text messages.</li>
  <li>L2.01.1c: A captain or co-captain cannot be on probation from a code-of-conduct violation.</li>
</ul>
<p>L2.01.2: Captains must be declared for each team prior to season, as 
  they are given access to Facebook Captains group to help coordinate the 
  season, and special software access for league nights.</p>

<p>L2.01.3: If neither captain can attend league night, a substitute 
  captain must be declared. It should be a roster player with at least one
  full season played. If there is no such player, then the player with 
  the most experience should be named. Whoever is named should touch base 
  with the opposing team captain prior to the match for a quick tutorial 
  on using the software. Notification, must be declared at least a day 
  ahead of the match, and the board included to enable them access to software.</p>

<p>L2.01.4: Mid-season changes in captains, or a temporary substitute 
  captain, need to be made at least 48 hours prior to the match to the 
  Board, so that appropriate software permissions can be put into place 
  for league night software.</p>
<h2 id="L2.02">L2.02 - Roster</h2>
<p>L2.02.0: The names of each player on the team must be submitted by 
  the captain to league officials six weeks prior to the start of each 
  season.</p>

<p>L2.02.1: Roster changes may be made at anytime throughout the season.
  Roster changes must be made more than 24 hours before a match; 
  otherwise players involved will fall under the substitution rules. 
  &nbsp;Roster changes made within 24 hours, will be applied after the 
  match.</p>
<h2 id="L2.03">L2.03 - Restrictions (Team IPR)</h2>
<p>L2.03.0: In an effort to maintain competitiveness throughout the 
  league, team restrictions are used to prevent a team from loading up 
  with too many top players, and helping distribute the top players to 
  different teams across the league. For roster members, team restrictions
  are reconsidered each time there is a roster change. The new roster 
  cannot violate the team restrictions, otherwise the change is not 
  approved by the league.</p>

<p>L2.03.1: Following are the details of the team restrictions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>L2.03.1a: Individual Player Rating (IPR) is a rating of 1 (novice)
    to 6 (very strong) for each player, which is computed based on their
    <a href="https://www.ifpapinball.com/players/find.php"> IFPA World Ranking (IFPA Rank)</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://matchplay.events/live/ratings">Matchplay.events Rating (MBR)</a></li>
  <li>L2.03.1b: The distribution of IPR for all players in the league is
    on a curve. &nbsp;1 is a novice player; 2 is below the median, 3 
    through 6 are above the median. &nbsp;Bottom 30% of eligible players 
    receive an IPR of ‘1’; the top 5% of players are assigned a 6 - this 
    applies to the players who are ranked in (or close to) the IFPA top 500 
    worldwide, or who have a rating on par with those worldwide rankings. 
    &nbsp;The curve is re-evaluated at each IPR freeze, to retain the 
    specified percentiles despite roster changes that may happen throughout
    the season.</li>
  <li>L2.03.1c: The IPR data will be recomputed three times each season.
    At the start of each season, approximate dates of the updates will be
    announced by the board; the board reserves the right to update when or
    if an update is performed. When recomputed, the IPRs then become fixed
    for each player until the next recomputation. This enables teams to plan
    ahead for substitutes and roster changes and not have to worry about an
    IPR changing the night of an event because of newly reported data. The
    approximate “freeze” dates will be posted on the home page each season,
    and will occur approximately one week before week 1, once mid-season,
    and once just before playoffs.</li>
  <li>L2.03.1d: The IPR data displayed on the website is stored in a back-end
    <i>MNP Ratings Spreadsheet</i>, not directly accessible to the public, but
    available for review by Captains and the Board of Directors should the need
    arise. &nbsp;The computed IPRs are included throughout the website alongside
    player names, and available in a player search website for access by the 
    public.</li>
  <li>L2.03.1e: The spreadsheet includes the MNP Ratings for every roster
    player. The spreadsheet also includes players who may not currently be
    on a team roster, but who have been a sub or played as a roster member
    for the league in the past.</li>
  <li>L2.03.1f: The algorithm for converting from IFPA Rank and MPR to an IPR
    is provided in the RP Method tab of the spreadsheet.</li>
  <li>L2.03.1g: Team Rating is the sum of IPR for all roster players on a team,
    as shown on the Teams tab of the spreadsheet.</li>
  <li>L2.03.1h: Team Rating Cap is the Team Rating value at which a team
    is constrained and is used to determine which players they can add to 
    the roster or as subs. The team rating cap is 36 for 10 players, 35 for
    9 players, 34 for 8 players.</li>
  <li>L2.03.1i: A team cannot add a new player with Individual Player 
    Rating (IPR) of 2 or higher as a sub or roster member, if it would cause
    the team rating to exceed a cap (see above rule L2.03.1h). &nbsp;A team
    at or above the cap can only add novice/new players (IPR 1) to their 
    roster.</li>
  <li>L2.03.1j: For a player that plays regularly but new to MNP, use the
    following tool to determine a player's rating: PLAYER LOOKUP on MNP Home Page.</li>
  <li>L2.03.1k: New players with no rating and no IFPA record are given an IPR of 1.</li>
  <li>L2.03.1l: If a captain is uncertain of a player's IPR using the methods
    above, and it could affect whether or not a particular sub or roster player
    can be used, then contact the Rules Commissioner to obtain a ruling on that
    player's eligibility.</li>
  <li>L2.03.1m: A team cannot add a roster player with IPR=6 if there is already
    one player with IPR=6 on the roster.</li>
  <li>L2.03.1n: A team cannot add a substitute player with IPR=6 if there is
    already a player with IPR=6 in the match’s lineup.</li>
  <li>L2.03.1o: Note that rating data will never be perfect. However, it
    is the best we have to keep a balance and prevent the creation of a 
    super-team that can never lose.</li>
  <li>L2.03.1o.0: The Team Restrictions are also in place to encourage strong
    teams to add novice players to their rosters. More experienced/stronger
    players then become role models and coaches for players who are just starting
    to learn.</li>
  <li>L2.03.1o.1: League officials reserve the right to assign an IPR to a player
    higher or lower than what is computed, if it can be shown that due to
    insufficient or erroneous data, a player's IPR as shown in the spreadsheet
    or with the calculator is incorrect by at least 2. If it's an off-by-one
    issue, then the value in the ratings spreadsheet or calculator will be used.
    +/- 1 manual corrections will not be made.</li>
  <li>L2.03.1p: Players who suppress themselves in IFPA rankings, or 
    intentionally attempt to evade pinball ranking systems of matchplay
    or IFPA through use of different or inconsistent names, will
    be assigned an IPR of 6, and treated as a top-ranked player.</li>
</ul>

<p>L2.03.2: A team is considered an IPR Grandfathered team if the Team
  IPR of the roster players exceed the Team Cap. This occurs as a side
  effect of re-computing the IPR with some of the roster players improving
  their IPR. A team will not forcibly be split-up if they go above the
  Team Cap, but they do become subjected to additional rules to keep the
  team in-tact, as defined here. These rules have been informally known as
  the IPR Grandfathering rules.</p>

<ul>
<li>L2.03.2a: If a team is IPR-Grandfathered at the start of a season,
  then roster players who do not play at least 2 of the first 5 matches
  for that team, must be dropped from the roster after Week 5. They can
  still play as a sub or rejoin the roster when doing so would have the
  team remain at or below the team cap.</li>
<li>L2.03.2b: If a team is IPR-Grandfathered at the start of a season,
  then roster players who do not play at least 5 of the team’s 10 regular
  season matches must be dropped from the roster prior to the start of the
  Playoffs. They can still play as a sub if the playoffs if doing so
  would have the team remain at or below the team cap (such as if a top
  player with IPR=6 is missing, they might be able to accommodate that
  dropped player as a sub).</li>
<li>L2.03.2c: If a team was not IPR-Grandfathered at the start of the
  season, but becomes grandfathered midway through the season, the roster
  members who do not play at least 2 of the team’s last 5 regular season
  matches must be dropped from the roster prior to playoffs.</li>
<li>L2.03.2d: If a team becomes IPR-Grandfathered at an update occurring
  immediately before playoffs, that will be treated the same as becoming
  IPR-Grandfathered at the start of the season. There is no minimum play
  requirement during playoff rounds.</li>
<li>L2.03.2e: If an IPR refresh causes an IPR-Grandfathered team, to no
  longer require the grandfather rule (because team IPR drops, or a
  previous IPR 6 becomes IPR &lt;6), the grandfathering requirements are
  removed.</li>
<li>L2.03.3: A team is considered an IPR6-Grandfathered team if two or
  more players have IPR=6, but the team is at or below the Team Cap. In
  this case, rules L2.03.2a, L2.03.2b, L2.03.2c, and L2.03.2d apply, but
  only to those players with IPR=6.</li>
<li>L2.03.4: If a player on an IPR-Grandfathered team, or an IPR=6
  player on an IPR6-Grandfathered team is suspended for a portion of the
  season, then their play eligibility is 50% or more of the regularly
  season matches for which they were not suspended.  If a player was
  suspended for 8 or more matches, then they can remain on the roster into
  the start of the next season. Any such player who is suspended 15 or
  more consecutive matches must be dropped from any Grandfathered team,
  and can rejoin only after their suspension is lifted, if they don’t
  violate the rules of adding a new player to the roster.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="L2.04">L2.04 - Expansion Team</h2>
<p>L2.04.0: A new team may apply for acceptance into the league, and 
  must meet the requirements listed in this document. Deadline to apply is
  approximately six weeks before season starts; the date will be 
  published on the website prior to each season. An existing team that is 
  requesting a move to a new location must also meet the venue 
  requirements listed in this document, and must apply for the change by 
  the same expansion team deadline date.</p>

<p>L2.04.1: The spots are limited, and MNP will not necessarily wait for
  everyone to apply; thus even though a deadline date is specified, 
  applying early does increase the chances of earning one of the expansion
  slots. If there are not sufficient qualified teams applying by the 
  deadline date, the league may choose to not expand.</p>

<p>L2.04.2: The proposed captain or co-captain for a new team is 
  responsible for submitting the team expansion application, and 
  individual players interested in the team are responsible for 
  individually signing up. Provide as much advance notice as possible to 
  one of the board members of your intent to create a team. This will 
  allow the board to inform you of any upcoming changes or concerns that 
  can affect your expansion application.</p>

<p>L2.04.3: The application is to be emailed by the proposed captain to
  <a href="mailto:seattlemnp@gmail.com">seattlemnp@gmail.com</a>, and must
  include the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Proposed Home Venue</li>
  <li>Proposed Team Name</li>
  <li>Names of Captain and Co-Captain</li>
  <li>Names of at least 6 (up to 8) other COMMITTED players (see below)</li>
  <li>Name and contact info of the venue owner or operator who is approving the team at their venue.</li>
</ul>
<p>L2.04.4: Expansion teams are not guaranteed; the application
  will be reviewed by the board and a determination made. Reasons for not granting
  an expansion team could be issues with experience of captains, problems with the
  selected venue, limitation of number of teams in the league and schedule, confidence
  in the roster players selected, or any other reason that creates a concern for
  accepting the new team into the league. In order to maximize chance of success for
  an expansion team application, the prospective captains should contact the league
  commissioner as soon as possible to discuss plans and ensure all concerns are
  addressed before the application deadline.</p>
<p>L2.04.5: Proposed Captains and Co-Captains should also request to join the
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/280092795481317/">MNP Captain's Facebook Group</a>&nbsp;as
  Facebook messaging and Groups is the primary means for keeping in touch with captains.</p>
<h1 id="L3.00">L3.00 - Player</h1>
<p>L3.00.0: A person may substitute, or become a roster member for any 
  team, at any time throughout the season, with the following restrictions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>L3.00.0a: the person played fewer than 6 matches with a single other team. &nbsp;A
    player that has played 6 or more matches with a team, the player is ‘locked’ into that
    team for the playoffs.</li>
  <li>L3.00.0b: the person is not listed on the roster of any other league team.</li>
  <li>L3.00.0c: the person is not a minor (must be 21 by the date of the team’s next match).</li>
  <li>L3.00.0d: the person is not suspended from the league.</li>
  <li>L3.00.0e: the person is not expelled or banned from the league.</li>
  <li>L3.00.0f: the person is not banned from participating in pinball events by another
    organization (such as IFPA, PAPA, NWPAS, NWPC); the MNP Board will make a determination
    on whether a banned player is allowed in the league.</li>
</ul>
<p>L3.00.1: A player banned from one or more venues may still play in MNP, but will require
  a sub for any matches scheduled at a venue to which the player is banned. &nbsp;Furthermore,
  a player may not play as a roster member nor as a sub, for a team that has a home venue to
  which the player is banned.</p>
<h2 id="L3.01">L3.01 - Conduct and Boycotts</h2>
<p>L3.01.0: There is a conduct section in the <a href="https://www.mondaynightpinball.com/matchrules">Match Rules for Monday Night Pinball</a>&nbsp;(M6.00
  - Player Conduct). &nbsp;The player conduct described there should be 
  honored any time playing at a Monday Night Pinball venue.</p>

<p>L3.01.1: Forfeit rules are in place for extraordinary 
  situations where a team makes every effort to field a team, but cannot.
  A forfeit for any reason that is related to the opposing player(s),
  venue, or team, is considered a boycott. Any coordination among two or
  more teams to take the same forfeit action is considered a boycott.
  Any captain or player who encourages other teams to boycott may also be 
  subjected to penalty, even if their team does not play the team or venue 
  they recommend boycotting. We do respect that captains and teams may have
  grievances against other venues. Those teams are encouraged to find 
  alternate means of demonstrating their dissatisfaction that does not affect
  the rights of the players on the opposing team or the league. For 
  grievances against individuals on the opposing team, those need to be brought 
  up to the MNP Board. The board will review, and take action if necessary. Their 
  decision is final and binding. Failure to abide by such decisions will incur
  a penalty.</p>

<h2 id="L3.02">L3.02 - Solo Players Looking for a Team</h2>
<p>L3.02.0: Players who are interested in joining a team should 
  asked their local bar tender about their team captains. Captains form and
  maintain their team's roster. It is a team captain's decision, not
  a league decision, on any player joining a specific team.</p>

<p>L3.02.1: Players looking to substitute of join teams are encouraged to joing
  the <a HREF="https://www.facebook.com/groups/mnprecruiting">MNP Player Recruiting</a>
  Facebook Group, where they can monitor for captains looking for players, or post
  themselves to indicate availability and preferred venues or geographic areas.
  
<h1 id="L4.00">L4.00 - Season</h1>
<p>L4.00.0: There are two seasons per year (Spring and Fall).The regular season consists of 10 weeks of play.</p>
<ul>
  <li>L4.00.0a: A regular season typically consists of 10 weeks of play, but could sometimes be more or less.</li>
  <li>L4.00.0b: The Spring season typically begins early February, and ends with finals prior to Memorial Day.</li>
  <li>L4.00.0c: The Fall season typically begins Monday after labor day, and ends with finals prior to Christmas Eve.</li>
  <li>L4.00.0d: Approximately half of matches will be at the team's home venue. The remaining will be away.</li>
  <li>L4.00.0e: The full schedule will be created and distributed prior to the start of the season.</li>
  <li>L4.00.0f: Number of teams, group organization, and distribution of matches may
    change from season to season, depending on the number and venue of teams that season.</li>
</ul>
<p>L4.00.1: The typical season schedule is the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>L4.00.1a: About six weeks prior to season, deadline for teams to apply for next season
    (includes both returning and expansion teams)</li>
  <li>L4.00.1b: About 3 weeks prior to season, draft schedule published for captains only</li>
  <li>L4.00.1c: About 2 weeks prior to season, final schedule published and distributed</li>
  <li>L4.00.1d: 10 regular season weeks, not necessarily consecutive. There may be one or more
    off weeks due to a Monday Holiday or special event at one or more MNP venues.</li>
  <li>L4.00.1e: 4 Playoff weeks.</li>
  <li>L4.00.1f: When the calendar permits, 1 week after Playoff week reserved for makeup</li>
</ul>
<p>L4.00.2: If a week is canceled for any reason (eg weather) and there is a spare week
  at the end of the season, then all regular scheduled weeks continue on date per schedule.
  The postponed week will be played as week 11, and playoffs pushed one week, with finals 
  now on that makeup date.</p>
<ul>
  <li>L4.00.2a: If there are no spare weeks, or more than one regular season week is missing, 
    some weeks of matches will be outright canceled and not made up.</li>
</ul>

<p>L4.00.3: No more than two matches will be scheduled
  at the same venue.</p>

<h2 id="L4.01">L4.01 - Groups</h2>
<p>L4.01.0: For the entirety of the regular season of play, the league is
  split into multiple groups, with each group standings considered separately for playoff
  berth. Teams within a group do not necessarily play each other. Groups are random collections
  of teams that are geographically disparate and represent a cross section of skill across
  the league, and could change from one season to the next for any reason. The main criteria
  for allocating teams to the same group is that they share a majority set of common opponents, 
  thus their records are comparable more than teams with completely different set of opponents. </p>
<p>L4.01.1: With 32 or more teams, the league will be split into four groups.

<h2 id="L4.02">L4.02 - Standings</h2>
<p>L4.02.0: League standings are maintained based on win/loss/tie record, with cumulative
  match points recorded as the first tiebreaker. A tie is worth half the value of a win.</p>

<p class="note">NOTE: Since match points earned is used to break ties, it is important to
  play every game during match play. Do not end a match early simply because one team has
  earned enough points to record a match win.</p>

<p>L4.02.1: At the end of the regular season, if two teams have the same record and same
  number of match points, then their head-to-head result will be considered to break the
  tie. If they did not play each other, their record vs common opponents will be used to
  break the tie. If still tied, their points vs common opponents is used. If still tied, the
  league will flip a coin. Only ties that affect playoff berth or seeding will be broken.</p>

<h2 id="L4.03">L4.03 - Playoff Seeding/Bracket</h2>
<p>L4.03.0: The MNP Playoffs will declare two winners, an overall Grand Champion, and a
  B Bracket winner. The B Bracket (also referred to as simply B) is made up of 4 of the
  teams who do not advance past the first round of the playoffs (see L4.03.5).  All teams
  that do advance beyond the first round is referred to as the A Bracket (see L4.03.4).</p>

<p>L4.03.1: Each group is ranked separately. The remainder of this rule
  applies to 32 or more teams. (Due to league growth, rules applying to less than 32 teams
  have been suppressed, but can be revived if the league's side were to be reduced.)</p>
<ul>
<li>L4.03.1a: The top 4 teams in each group advance to the playoffs. There are no byes.</li>
<li>L4.03.1b: The Bracket Round playoff matches may be different each season,
  depending on which groups are primarily playing other groups. The Bracket Round playoff matches
  will be published along with the schedule at the start of the system.</li>
</ul>

<p>L4.03.2: Playoffs consist of four weeks of play.  Week 1 is Bracket Round. Week 2 will
  have the A Quarter Finals and B Semi Finals. Week 3 will have the A Semi Finals and B
  Finals. Week four will be the A Finals.</p>

<p>L4.03.3: Seeding of teams is as follows, with 32 or more teams and 4 Groups</p>
<ul>
  <li>L4.03.3a: The team with best record in each group is Seed #1 within their group for
    purposes of Round 1.</li>
  <li>L4.03.3b: The top 4 seeds overall will be obtained by seeding the winner
    of each group based on their WLT record then total points earned, and seeded ahead of any team
    finishing 2nd or lower in any group. </li>
  <li>L4.03.3c: The remaining teams have seeds sorted by their record (WLT first, then total
    points earned as tie-breaker). In Bracket Round 1, the seeding is done within the group
    only. In Round 2, the seeding is done overall by combining the records of all groups.</li>
  <li>L4.03.3d: The seeding for B Semi Finals and Finals is NOT based on WLT record, but rather
    based on average Team IPR during the season, with lowest average Team IPR getting the
    highest seed.</li>
  </ul>  

<p class="note">Note: per rule L4.00.3, no more than two matches will be scheduled at the same
  venue. If the seeding results in more than two teams from the same venue as the home team, the
  lower seeded home team must select a neutral venue, or play at the visiting team's venue. This
  decision must be declared at least 5 days in advance of the scheduled playoff match.
</p>
   
<p>L4.03.4: The A Quarter Finals will consist of the winners of Bracket Round. The 8 teams are
  seeded per L4.03.3, then pairings are 1st Seed vs 8th Seed, 2nd Seed vs 7th Seed, 3rd Seed
  vs 6th Seed, and 4th Seed vs 5th Seed. The teams seeded 1st through 4th are the home teams.</p>

<p>L4.03.5: The B Semi Finals will consist of four of the teams losing in the Bracket Round.
  The four teams selected to play will be the four teams with the lowest average team IPR 
  throughout the season. For this B Semi Finals, seeding will be done by lowest average season
  team IPR, such that the lowest value gets highest seed, second lowest gets the second seed,
  and so on. Pairings will be 1st Seed vs 4th Seed and 2nd Seed vs 3rd Seed. The teams seeded
  1st and 2nd are the home teams.</p>
  
<p>L4.03.6: The A Semi Finals will consist of the four winning quarter finalists. Again teams
  will be seeded by their regular season record. The pairings are 1st vs 4th, and 2nd vs 3rd.
  Teams seeded 1st and 2nd are the home teams.</p>

<p>L4.03.7: The B Finals will consist of the two winning teams from the B Semi Finals. The team
  with the lowest average season team IPR is the home team.</p>

<p>L4.03.8: The A Finals night will consist of all four teams that played in the Semi Finals.
  The two winners play each other for the league championship. The other two teams play each
  other to determine 3rd and 4th place. </p>
  
<p>L4.03.9 The A Finals night is held at an independent location that is not home team for any
  of the four finalists. For purposes of what team selects 1st or 2nd, the team with the better
  record in each finals match will be considered the home team, even though the venue is not
  their home venue. </p>

<p>L4.03.10: The neutral venue for finals is selected by the MNP board using the following rules,
  if a single venue is used for both finals matches: </p>
<ul>
  <li>L4.03.10a: The venue is selected upon completion of the quarter final round, when
    semi-finalists (final four) in each division are known.</li>
  <li>L4.03.10b: Only venues that have 15 or more league-worthy machines and ability to support
    more than 40 players are considered.</li>
  <li>L4.03.10c: The venue must have hosted all home games for least one home team during that
    season, and never had a match moved to an alternate venue due to machine league-worthiness
    issues.</li>
  <li>L4.03.10d: The venues who have least recently hosted one of the finals will be given top priority.</li>
  <li>L4.03.10e: The venue owner is asked and must agree to host the finals without any conflicting
    events, or that venue is moved back to the bottom of the priority list.</li>
  <li>L4.03.10f: A venue that has a team in semi-finals of each division will be skipped.</li>
</ul>
<p>L4.03.11: Based on the above rules, the MNP board identifies the two neutral venue for the finals.
  The MNP board shall make the choice whenever two venues are 'tied' for highest priority (such as
  they both hosted 3 seasons ago, so in theory after equal priority from the perspective of how
  long ago they hosted).</p>

<p>L4.03.12: The final four A teams and final two B teams receive MNP trophies to hold onto for a
  season. The trophies must be returned at the start of playoffs of the next season for redistribution.
  If a team wants something to keep to memorialize a win, they are welcome to create their own trophy
  or plaque for more permanent display at their home venue. Funds for that must come from the team
  players or the venue.</p>
