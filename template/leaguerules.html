<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monday Night Pinball is a co-ed team league where each team has a host bar, which serves as the team's "home." Once a week for the duration of the season, each team will compete against another team in their league, either at "home" or as the visiting team at their opponent's bar. Each team will score match points based on the results of the individual pinball games. At the end of each match, the team with the most points will record a win, while the other team will record a loss. League standings are determined based on a simple win/loss record then cumulative match points as the main tiebreaker.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">L1.00.0: Each team in the league has a home venue. The venue must meet the requirements listed in this section.</span></p>
<h2 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 17.7px 0.0px; line-height: 24.0px; font: 21.3px Arial; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1">L1.01 - Requirements</span></h2>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li7"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">L1.01.0: Location must have a minimum of 8 machines in league-worthy condition. See information below on description of </span><span class="s6">league-worthy</span><span class="s1">.</span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">L1.01.1: A location may host no more than two teams.</span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">L1.01.2: A location may only host one new team in any given season, be it an expansion team or an existing team relocating.</span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">L1.01.3: A newly opening location must already be open by the application deadline date. If not, the expansion team request needs to be for an alternate location that is capable of hosting the team, but they can specify their interest to move to the new location when it opens.</span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">L1.01.4: The pinball area at the location must be big enough to accommodate at least 24 players (20 players plus a few guests).</span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">L1.01.5: No cover charge for location. Players are expected to pay for play, but should not need to pay anything beyond that. An exception is if cover charge is $5 or less per person and all machines are on free play, on both league nights and when players go to practice.</span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">L1.01.6: Location must sell at least beer or wine (i.e. must have liquor license). This is a barcade league, not a family league!</span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">L1.01.7: Location must be open (or willing to stay open) until at least midnight on league nights. If they close before midnight, they must also be willing to stay open on league nights until the end of the match.</span></li>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">L1.02.0: A machine is league-worthy if it meets the following criteria:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li7"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">L1.02.0a: Machine is primarily pinball. A machine with a video mode is OK, but a machine in which more than 10% of the time is in video mode, or for which you can lose your turn by losing video mode instead of draining a ball, are not eligible.</span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">L1.02.0b: All switches are registering (it’s ok if one switch is not registering but is not crucial to game play that nobody really complains about it). Shots or features not working but have suitable compensation enabled (like disabling claw in Demolition Man) is acceptable.</span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">L1.02.0c: Lower flippers are strong enough to hit every shot, even after the machine has been in constant use for 30 minutes. Upper flippers are strong enough to make crucial shots (a broken upper flipper on some games like Mars Trek is acceptable, but on most games it isn’t).</span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">L1.02.0d: Most (preferably all) lights are working. Key lights are all working.</span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">L1.02.0e: Playfield is reasonably clean, and doesn’t have a year of grime build-up.</span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">L1.02.0f: Balls rarely get stuck.</span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">L1.02.0g: Machine does not regularly glitch, such as resetting mid-game, ending balls prematurely, creating arbitrary multi-balls or not serving multiple balls during multi-ball, etc. A machine that does this rarely (e.g. at most once a day) is ok; if it happens in that case, malfunction rules apply. If it’s happening more frequently, the machine is not league worthy.</span></li>
</ul>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">L1.03.0: A new venue will be evaluated for possible play upon request to the MNP Board. A board member will visit the venue and approve if it meets the Venue requirements.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">L1.03.1: Once a venue is approved, a team can list that venue as their choice for home venue six weeks prior to a season. That venue can also be used as a backup location if an existing venue fails to have at least five working machines.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">L1.03.2: If a new venue is not yet open six weeks prior to start of season, then the team must pick a different venue as their home, and make a request to move to the new venue once it is approved. If such a request is not made prior to the season start, then the team will need to wait until the following season to move to that venue.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<h1 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 17.9px 0.0px; line-height: 30.0px; font: 26.7px Arial; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1">L2.00 - Team</span></h1>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">L2.00.0: Teams consist of at least 8 players, and no more than 10.  Of these, one player will act as the Team Captain. A second player must be named as a co-captain.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">L2.00.1: The team must have a designated venue, which shall host the “home” matches.  At least six weeks prior to start of a season, per published deadlines, both returning teams and expansion teams must declare their home venue.</span></p>
<h2 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 17.7px 0.0px; line-height: 24.0px; font: 21.3px Arial; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1">L2.01 - Captains</span></h2>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">L2.01.0: The team’s Captain and Co-Captain are collectively referred to as the team’s Captains.  Captains are responsible for organizing their team and corresponding promptly with the league about rosters, scoring and scheduling. Captains also serve as team representatives in each of the matches.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">L2.01.1: The captains must meet the following requirements.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li7"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">L2.01.1a: Captain and co-captain must each have already played in at least one full season in MNP.</span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">L2.01.1b: Captains and co-captains should have a Facebook account, and must be part of the Facebook Monday Night Pinball Captains group, as that is how communication with captains from the league occurs. Alternately, a captain may designate a proxy with a Facebook account, to handle correspondence with league officials.  Captains without a Facebook account must supply the MNP Board with a contact email address and a phone number where they can accept text messages.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">L2.01.2: Captains must be declared for each team prior to season, as they are given access to Facebook Captains group to help coordinate the season, and special software access for league nights.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">L2.01.3: If neither captain can attend league night, a substitute captain must be declared. It should be a roster player with at least one full season played. If there is no such player, then the player with the most experience should be named. Whoever is named should touch base with the opposing team captain prior to the match for a quick tutorial on using the software.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">L2.01.4: Mid-season changes in captains, or a temporary substitute captain, need to be made at least 48 hours prior to the match to the Board, so that appropriate software permissions can be put into place for league night software.</span></p>
<h2 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 17.7px 0.0px; line-height: 24.0px; font: 21.3px Arial; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1">L2.02 - Roster</span></h2>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">L2.02.0: The names of each player on the team must be submitted by the captain to league officials six weeks prior to the start of each season.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">L2.02.1: Roster changes may be made at anytime throughout the season. Roster changes must be made more than 24 hours before a match; otherwise players involved will fall under the substitution rules.  Roster changes made within 24 hours, will be applied after the match.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<h2 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 17.7px 0.0px; line-height: 24.0px; font: 21.3px Arial; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1">L2.03 - Restrictions (Team IPR)</span></h2>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">L2.03.0: In an effort to maintain competitiveness throughout the league, team restrictions are used to prevent a team from loading up with too many top players, and helping distribute the top players to different teams across the league. For roster members, team restrictions are reconsidered each time there is a roster change. The new roster cannot violate the team restrictions, otherwise the change is not approved by the league.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">         </span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">L2.03.1: Following are the details of the team restrictions.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li7"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">L2.03.1a: Individual Player Rating (IPR) is a rating of 1 (novice) to 6 (very strong) for each player, which is computed based on their<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ifpapinball.com/players/find.php&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1566703505909000"><span class="s7"> </span><span class="s5">IFPA World Ranking (IFPA Rank)</span></a> and<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://matchplay.events/live/ratings&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1566703505910000"><span class="s7"> </span><span class="s5">Matchplay.events Rating (MBR)</span></a> </span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">L2.03.1b: The distribution of IPR for all players in the league is on a curve.  1 is a novice player; 2 is below the median, 3 through 6 are above the median.  Bottom 30% of eligible players receive an IPR of ‘1’; the top 5% of players are assigned a 6 - this applies to the players who are ranked in (or close to) the IFPA top 250 worldwide, or who have a rating on par with those worldwide rankings.  The curve is re-evaluated at each IPR freeze, to retain the specified percentiles despite roster changes that may happen throughout the season.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">L2.03.1c: The IPR data will be recomputed three times each season. When recomputed, the IPRs then become fixed for each player until the next recomputation. This enables teams to plan ahead for substitutes and roster changes and not have to worry about an IPR changing the night of an event because of newly reported data. The approximate “freeze” dates will be posted on the home page each season, and will occur approximately one week before week 1, once mid-season, and once just before playoffs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>

  <li class="li7"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">L2.03.1e: The spreadsheet includes the MNP Ratings for every roster player. The spreadsheet also includes players who may not currently be on a team roster, but who have been a sub or played as a roster member for the league in the past.</span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">L2.03.1f: The algorithm for converting from IFPA Rank and MPR to an IPR is provided in the RP Method tab of the spreadsheet.</span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">L2.03.1g: Team Rating is the sum of IPR for all roster players on a team, as shown on the Teams tab of the spreadsheet.         </span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">L2.03.1h: Team Rating Cap is the Team Rating value at which a team is constrained and is used to determine which players they can add to the roster or as subs. The team rating cap for Spring 2019 is 40 for 10 players, 39 for 9 players, 38 for 8 players.         </span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">L2.03.1i: A team cannot add a new player with Individual Player Rating (IPR) of 2 or higher as a sub or roster member, if it would cause the team rating to exceed a cap (see above rule L2.03.1h).  A team at or above the cap can only add novice/new players (IPR 1) to their roster.</span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">L2.03.1j: For a player that plays regularly but new to MNP, use the following tool to determine a player's rating: PLAYER LOOKUP on MNP Home Page.        </span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">L2.03.1k: New players with no rating and no IFPA record are given an IPR of 1.         </span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">L2.03.1l: If a captain is uncertain of a player's IPR using the methods above, and it could affect whether or not a particular sub or roster player can be used, then contact the Rules Commissioner to obtain a ruling on that player's eligibility.         </span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">L2.03.1m: A team cannot add a roster player with IPR=6 if there is already one player with IPR=6 on the roster.</span></li>

  <li class="li7"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">L2.03.1o: Note that rating data will never be perfect. However, it is the best we have to keep a balance and prevent the creation of a super-team that can never lose.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>

<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li7"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">L2.03.1o.0: The Team Restrictions are also in place to encourage strong teams to add novice players to their rosters. More experienced/stronger players then become role models and coaches for players who are just starting to learn.</span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">L2.03.1o.1: League officials reserve the right to assign an IPR to a player higher or lower than what is computed, if it can be shown that due to insufficient or erroneous data, a player's IPR as shown in the spreadsheet or with the calculator is incorrect by at least 2. If it's an off-by-one issue, then the value in the ratings spreadsheet or calculator will be used. +/- 1 manual corrections will not be made.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li7"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">L2.03.1p: Since MNP relies on public data in both the IFPA and Matchplay.event databases, we do not support the suppression of players. We believe it is a necessary public metric for fair competitive play. While Matchplay.events does not allow players to suppress themselves, IFPA does. Matchplay ratings alone will be used for players who have suppressed themselves from IFPA, unless the player is known to have played in major tournaments, in which case they will be assigned an automatic IPR of 6.</span></li>

An existing team that is requesting a move to a new location must also meet the location requirements listed in this document, and must apply for the change by the same expansion team deadline date.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">L2.04.1: The spots are limited, and MNP will not necessarily wait for everyone to apply; thus even though a deadline date is specified, applying early does increase the chances of earning one of the expansion slots. If there are not sufficient qualified teams applying by the deadline date, the league may choose to not expand. Any expansion team granted will be assigned to Division 2. Division 1 will remain at exactly 12 teams.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">L4.01.0: The league is structured in two divisions, called Division 1 and Division 2. Division 1 was initially established with the 12 strongest teams in the league. Each season through promotion, relegation, disbanding, and expansion, the teams in this division are adjusted. All remaining teams are in Division 2.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">L4.01.1: Expansion teams are always added to Division 2. Teams in Division 1 that lose more than 5 of their players between seasons will automatically be disbanded and must re-apply as an expansion team, and will re-enter in Division 2.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">L4.01.2: Relegation / Promotion: After each season, the highest ranked teams in Division 2 will be promoted to Division 1. Some lowest-ranked teams in Division 1 will be relegated to Division 2, in order to keep Division 1 at 12 players. The guidelines for promotion and relegation are the following.  The Board of Directors will make the final decision of who is promoted and relegated, based on applying the following guidelines:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li7"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">L4.01.2a: A team’s likelihood of being promoted or relegated are based on the number of wins they obtain during the season, including playoff wins.

  <li class="li7"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">L4.01.2b: Teams with at least 11 or more wins (including playoffs) in Division 2 are destined to be promoted to Division 1.</span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">L4.01.2c: Teams with 8 or less wins (including playoffs) are destined to remain in Division 2.</span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">L4.01.2d: Teams with 2 or less wins in Division 1 are destined to be relegated to Division 2.</span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">L4.01.2e: Teams with 5 or more wins will remain in Division 1, unless they don't retain at least 5 of their 10 players.</span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">L4.01.2f: If there's an uneven number of teams eligible for promotion and relegation, then the Board of Directors will decide which Division 2 teams with 9 or 10 wins might also be promoted, and which teams with 3 or 4 wins in Division 1 might also be relegated. If this is not sufficient to ensure exactly 12 teams in Division 1, then only in that case might a team end up in a division different than what they are destined for, based on above bullets.</span></li>

<p class="p10"><span class="s1">NOTE: Since match points earned is used to break ties, it is important to play every game during match play. Do not end a match early simply because one team has earned enough points to record a match win.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">L4.02.1: At the end of the regular season, if two teams have the same record and same number of match points, then their head-to-head result will be considered to break the tie. If they did not play each other, their record vs common opponents will be used to break the tie. If still tied, their points vs common opponents is used. If still tied, the league will flip a coin.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">L4.03.4: Except for the championship finals, the team with the higher seed gets home-field advantage, with the match played at their home location. Location of championship finals and consolation finals is a neutral location that is not home for any of the final four teams. Location of these matches is to be announced no later than 48 hours after conclusion of Quarter Finals match, but could be announced earlier if the planned host does not have any home team in the playoffs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">L4.03.5: The regular season schedule is created to avoid two matches in the same location, but on rare occasions it can happen, in favor of meeting other scheduling criteria. In Finals, there is always two matches doubled-up, and larger locations are selected as the neutral locations. When there is doubling up, the captains for one of the two matches can agree to start either 15 minutes earlier, with picks at 8:30pm, or 15 minutes later with picks at 9:00pm. As long as the matches are staggered, the night should run smoothly. If captains don't agree on a time shift, then everything starts on schedule at 8:45pm, and the teams simply need to wait for machines when there are conflicts. On these nights, players should not practice between rounds on machines selected for use by the other match.</span></p>

  <li class="li7"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">L4.03.6c: Only venues that have 15 or more league-worthy machines and ability to support more than 40 players are considered.</span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">L4.03.6d: The venue must have hosted all home games for least one home team during that season, and never had a match moved to an alternate location due to machine league-worthiness issues.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">L4.03.6e: The venues who have least recently hosted one of the finals will be given top priority.</span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">L4.03.6f: The venue owner is asked and must agree to host the finals, or that venue is moved back to the bottom of the priority list.</span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">L4.03.6g: A venue that has a team in semi-finals of each division will be skipped.</span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">L4.03.6h: A venue with team in one division can be a neutral location for the other division.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">L4.03.7: Based on the above rules, the MNP board identifies the two neutral locations for the finals.
