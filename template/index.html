Seattleâ€™s Monday Night Pinball league has established a set of five core values that best define the spirit of the league, and are used to navigate decision making. The values are:

<ul>
<li>Sportsmanship</li>
<li>Community</li>
<li>Learning</li>
<li>Competition</li>
<li>Fun</li>
</ul>

We encourage players to keep all five values in mind as a basis for their participation in the league.
