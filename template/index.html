<h2>Monday Night Pinball</h2>
<br/>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
  Monday Night Pinball is a friendly competitive pinball bar league in the Greater Seattle Metropolitan Area that
  aims to build interest in the hobby and encourage players and their teams to grow together. The league consists
  of 34 teams spread out over 20 venues, where each venue hosts one, two or three teams. Each team fields 10
  players weekly, thus there are 340 players competing weekly across 10 matches. A pool of over 150 Subs allows
  every team to field a full 10 players, even when one or more of their regular roster members are absent during
  a league night. Membership is only $1 per player per season; Substitutes can participate at no cost. Players are
  responsible for paying for their own pinball games on league night.

Following that, any remaining teams in the quarter finals will be seeded by wins/ties/points regardless of their finishing position in the group. The 8 teams once seeded will play 8th at 1st, 7th at 2nd, 6th at 3rd and 5th at 4th in the quarter finals.</p>

<p>
New season begins Sept 11th 2023. Matches start at 8:15pm this season. Schedule is posted.
</p>
<p>
  Four new expansion teams are joining the league, pushing us up to 34 teams which in turn is leading to the need
  to restructure the groupings for purpose of standings. Starting this Fall 2023 season, there will be four groups,
  with 8 or more teams per group. Each group will have opponents that are mostly common, thus allowing the
  win-loss-tie and point standings for teams within the same group to be comparable.
  </p>
  <p>
  The top 4 teams in each group move on to the first round of the playoffs. There are no byes this year.
  </p>
  <p>
  First round matchups for Fall 2023 will be the following: 
  <ul>
  <li>Y4 at W1</li>
  <li>Y3 at W2</li>
  <li>W3 at Y2</li>
  <li>W4 at Y1</li>
  <li>Z4 at X1</li>
  <li>Z3 at X2</li>
  <li>X3 at Z2</li>
  <li>X4 at Z1</li>
  </ul>

A new Report Player Conduct page has been created. If you witness player conduct that is out of line, please report it.
</p>
<p>
  It is important to keep the league fun for everyone. Occasionally, players witness conduct by other players that goes against our player conduct rules, but the observers feel it's too minor to say something formally. However, we've also found that the culprits are also often the same players and such repeated conduct issues should be addressed.
</p>
<p>
  To address this need, we have added a  <a href="/conduct">Report Player Conduct</a> page, which allows anyone to report observed conduct issues. There won't be any action taken against an isolated minor incident, but the board does want to know about it, in order to monitor for potential repetitive conduct issues. If the same player receives multiple independent reports of independent incidents, then disciplinary action could follow, in the form of warnings or suspensions as appropriate.
</p>
<p>
  Reporting can optionally be done anonymously, if the reporter is concerned about any form of retribution.
