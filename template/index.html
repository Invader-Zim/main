<h2>Monday Night Pinball</h2>
<br/>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
  Monday Night Pinball is a friendly competitive pinball bar league in the Greater Seattle Metropolitan Area that aims to build 
  interest in the hobby and encourage players and their teams to grow together. The league consists of 30 teams spread out over 19 
  venus, where each venue hosts one, two or three teams. Each team fields 10 players weekly, thus there are 300 players competing weekly across 
  10 matches.  A pool of over 100 Subs allows every team to field a full 10 players, even when one or more of their regular roster members 
  are absent during a league night. Membership is only $1 per player per season; Substitutes can participate at no cost.  Players are responsible
  for paying for their own pinball games on league night.

A new Report Player Conduct page has been created. If you witness player conduct that is out of line, please report it.
</p>
<p>
  It is important to keep the league fun for everyone. Occasionally, players witness conduct by other players that goes against our player conduct rules, but the observers feel it's too minor to say something formally. However, we've also found that the culprits are also often the same players and such repeated conduct issues should be addressed.
</p>
<p>
  To address this need, we have added a  <a href="/conduct">Report Player Conduct</a> page, which allows anyone to report observed conduct issues. There won't be any action taken against an isolated minor incident, but the board does want to know about it, in order to monitor for potential repetitive conduct issues. If the same player receives multiple independent reports of independent incidents, then disciplinary action could follow, in the form of warnings or suspensions as appropriate.
</p>
<p>
  Reporting can optionally be done anonymously, if the reporter is concerned about any form of retribution.
