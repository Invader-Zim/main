<H3>Overview</H3>
<p>
  Monday Night Pinball is a friendly competitive pinball bar league in the Greater Seattle Metropolitan Area that aims to build 
  interest in the hobby and encourage players and their teams to grow together. The league consists of 26 teams spread out over 18 
  locations, where each location hosts one or two teams. Each team fields 10 players weekly, thus there are 260 players competing weekly across 
  13 matches.  A pool of over 100 Subs allows every team to field a full 10 players, even when one or more of their regular roster members 
  are absent during a league night. Membership is only $1 per player per season; Substitutes can participate at no cost.  Players are responsible
  for paying for their own pinball games on league night.
</p>
<P>
There are two seasons annually, one in Spring that runs from February to before Memorial Day. The other is in Fall that runs from 
after Labor Day through mid December. Each season consists of 11 regular season matches, then three weeks of playoffs. 
Each season crowns a Division 1 champion and awarded the Rodney Olsen Memorial Trophy. You can see the 
current champions and the trophy in the Cover Photo of our  
<A HREF="https://www.facebook.com/SeattleMondayNightPinball">Monday Night Pinball Facebook Group Page</A>. 2nd and 3rd place in Division 1, as
well as top 3 teams in Division 2, also receive trophies.  Teams have the opportunity to display the trophy for the duration of the following 
season. The trophies are then re-awarded on finals night of the subsequent season.

<h3>Fall 2019 Updates</h3>
<ul>

<li>Team and Division Updates:
  <ul>
  <li>Division 1 remains at 12 teams and Division 2 remains at 14 teams.</li>
  <li>Middle Flippers and Knight Riders move to Division 1 from Division 2.
  <li>DTP and Castle Crashes move from Division 2 to Division 1.
  <li>Drain Freeze at The Ice Box is returning under a new name, <i>Third Ball Charmers</i>.</li>
  <li>Locked and Loaded at Vidiot is returning under a new name, <i>True Survivors</i>.</li>
  </ul>

<li>Rule Updates:
  <ul>
  <li><B>Allowable Subs and Roster Player IPRs for teams at Team Cap</B> 
  A team that is at the Team IPR Cap, 
  can only add players that are a ‘1’ either as a sub on a given night, or a roster player. 
  Previously, it was a ‘1’ or ‘2’ for sub but just a ‘1’ for roster player which created an imbalance. 
  <li><B>New IPR distribution resulting in more IPR=1 players</B>
  To go along with rule change above, the IPR scaling has been adjusted so that more players are a ‘1’.
  Most players who were ranked a ‘2’ will now be a ‘1’, 
  leaving pool of eligible subs a similar size. The new scaling will be based on the following 
  percentiles: 1: 0 to 30%. 2: 30 to 50%. 3: 50 to 65%. 4: 65 to 80%. 5: 80 to 95%. 6: 95 to 100%. 
  This rescaling will cause about 25% of players overall to see their IPR decreased by 1, and as a result many 
  teams will see their Team IPR drop by one or more points too.

  <li><B>Number of Playoff Spots in Division 2</B> With 14 teams in Division 2, the Top 7 (instead of 6 last season) teams will make the playoffs. 
  Only the highest ranked team at the end of the season will get a playoff Bye. 
  Seeding for first playoff round will then be 2nd vs 7th, 3rd vs 6th, and 4thvs 5th.
  <li>The rule “Substitute players are not allowed to play more games than any roster player.” Has been removed. 
  This rule was from many seasons ago with different bonus point and sub rules, and has no need to still be on the books.
  <li> To alleviate arguments about practicing a machine that’s already been selected, the rule is being updated to state, 
  once a machine is locked in for selection in the software, 
  then neither team may start a new game on that machine. A game already in progress can finish. Violation of this will follow
  player conduct rules.
</ul>

<li>Rule Clarifications:
<ul>
  <li>The maximum Team IPR remains at 40, for 10 players. A team fielding only 9 players has a cap of 39. 
  A team fielding only 8 players has a cap of 38.
  <li>Rules have been split into two separate documents, one call Match Rules which pertains to rules that would most likely need to be referenced
  immediately prior or during a match, and League Rules, which pertain to all the other rules related to the league. Links to the separate documents
  are provided at top of this home page.
  <li>Rules have all been numbered, making it easier to reference a specific rule during discussions, or in text messaging or phone calls.
  <li>Rules will explicitly state that Plundering a ball in JJPOTC is to be treated like an Extra Ball to the player that earns the extra ball and must be plunged, 
  and as a major malfunction to the player who loses a ball, and thus can play a compensation ball to replace it.
  <li>Rules will explicitly state that Midnight Madness is a “play on”, and treated like a machine awarding a random award.
</ul>

<li>Approximate IPR Freeze Dates:
  <ul>
  <li>Pre-Season update: August 26, 2019</li>
  <li>Mid-Season update: October 15, 2019</li>
  <li>Pre-Playoff update: November 19, 2019</li>
  </ul>

</ul>

Seattle's Monday Night Pinball league has established a set of five core values that best define the spirit of the league, and are used to navigate decision making. The values are:

<ul>
<li>Sportsmanship</li>
<li>Community</li>
<li>Learning</li>
<li>Competition</li>
<li>Fun</li>
</ul>

We encourage players to keep all five values in mind as a basis for their participation in the league.
