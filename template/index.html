All, it has been recommended by one of the captains to delay the start of MNP's Spring 2022 season, currently scheduled for Monday Feb 7, due to current high COVID infection rates.
To obtain a fair assessment from the entire league, a questionnaire has been sent to the captains to assess your team's position in this matter. Please be sure to discuss your preference with your captain, whether it be to start as planned or delay the season, so that their answers accurately reflect your whole team.
A final decision on this matter will be made next week and posted here.
Thanks for your cooperation.
