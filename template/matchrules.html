<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monday Night Pinball is a co-ed team league where each team has a host bar</span><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s1">(AKA Venue), which serves as the team's "home." Once a week for the duration of the season, each team will compete against another team in their league, either at "home" or as the visiting team at their opponent's </span><span class="s4">venue</span><span class="s1">. Each team will score match points based on the results of the individual pinball games. At the end of each match, the team with the most points will record a win, while the other team will record a loss. League standings are determined based on a simple win/loss record then cumulative match points as the main tiebreaker.<br>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">M1.01.0: Venues need to continue to meet the same requirements set forth in the <a href="leaguerules"><span class="s10">League Rules for Monday Night Pinball</span></a>.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">                </span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">M1.01.1: If a team has advanced knowledge of a location not being available (or otherwise ineligible) on league night, they should notify the league and opposing captain when the issue is identified. The league and captains will discuss the best plan for upcoming league night, including the option of moving to another location preemptively based on the risk of the location not being available.                 </span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">M1.01.2 - Locations must have at least 8 machines per the location availability rules. On league night, at least 5 of them must be in league-worthy condition to host league play, or the match must move to another location. The league should be notified any time a location failed to meet this requirement. Repeated issues could lead to a team being forced to choose a new venue.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<h2 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 17.7px 0.0px; line-height: 24.0px; font: 21.3px Arial; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1">M1.02 - Captain Responsibilities</span></h2>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">M1.02.0: Captains on each team are selected for the difficult task of helping to run a smooth league that is distributed at many locations. The league relies on the captains to negotiate with one another to manage as many rulings as possible without league official intervention, in as fair a manner as possible. The league retains the right to remove captains who are not cooperative, and who put the advantage of their own team ahead of the interests of the league to run smoothly by not being willing to negotiate fair terms with the other captains.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">M1.02.1: Machines that are not league-worthy should not be used. Any machine that the venue has flagged as out-of-order, or is powered off, should not be used, even if both captains think the machine is OK to play. Any other machine is to be used, unless both captains agree that it is not league-worthy. If only one captain thinks a machine is not league-worthy, then the machine is "in" and available for selection. However, upon first occurrence of a situation that requires a major or beneficial malfunction ruling, then malfunction rules shall apply to that game, and the machine should not be used in subsequent rounds for the rest of the evening. If a minor malfunction continues to happen and is the same for both teams, then play continues.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">NOTE: See <a href="leaguerules"><span class="s10">League Rules for Monday Night Pinball</span></a> for details related to machine worthiness.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">M1.02.2: In all cases, league officials are only a text message or phone call away. They also play in the matches and might not be able to answer in a timely manner, but please feel free to contact league officials when necessary for help in making fair rulings.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">M1.02.3: Anytime captains are uncertain about how to deal with a situation, they may contact any board member for advice. During league night, Commissioner of Rules and Regulations is on standby to quickly address issues if possible (for contact info, see </span><span class="s5">M8.00 - Commissioner of Rules and Regulations</span><span class="s1">). Other board members are available as-needed to answer questions via text, voice, or in person if one happens to be on your team or the opposing team.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<h2 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 17.7px 0.0px; line-height: 24.0px; font: 21.3px Arial; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1">M1.03 - Start Time</span></h2>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">M1.03.0: Start time for MNP matches is 8:45pm. By 8:45pm, captains on both teams should have their lineup approved and the visiting team begins making their picks (see </span><span class="s5">M3.00 - Match Flow</span><span class="s1">). Match Flow and Scoring are managed by custom MNP software. All players can log in to enter scores. Captains are provided special permissions to enter match information and approve results. Instructions for using the software are provided to captains via the Captains group, with demos provided during warm-up week scrimmages.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">M1.03.1: Each round, teams should take no more than 5 minutes to make their picks, and responding team should take no more than 5 minutes to respond. To support this aggressive time table, players on the team should be planning their pick ahead of time. This guideline is in place to encourage all league members to be courteous to all, as many players work early on Tuesday mornings. Adhering to these limits enables most matches to end by 11:30pm, and longer nights due to some good games to still be done by midnight. If players want to warm up before a match, they should arrive much earlier than 8:45pm.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">M2.00.0: Each team must submit a lineup for the match.  The lineup consists of roster members, and optionally, one or more substitutes.  A full lineup consists of 10 players.  Team captains must confirm the opposing team’s lineup. Any player eligibility questions should be handled before confirming the roster.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<h2 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 17.7px 0.0px; line-height: 24.0px; font: 21.3px Arial; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1">M2.01 - Requirements</span></h2>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">M2.01.0: The lineup must meet the following requirements.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li7"><span class="s8"></span><span class="s1">M2.01.0a: The lineup consists of no more than 10 players.</span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s8"></span><span class="s1">M2.01.0b: The lineup will feature a minimum of 8 players.</span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s8"></span><span class="s1">M2.01.0c: A team is permitted to play with as few as 7 players, with an 8th/missing player.  This 8th/missing player scores a 1 in every game “played” (applies to doubles round).</span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li9"><span class="s8"></span><span class="s1">NOTE: If the game is doubles, it can be played as a 3-player game, with the missing player getting a 1.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li7"><span class="s8"></span><span class="s1">M2.01.0d: The lineup shall designate a captain, and a co-captain.  At least one of the lineup captains must be one of the team’s roster captains.  The lineup captain and co-captain must both be roster players.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li9"><span class="s8"></span><span class="s1">NOTE: This requirement is related to the league software, and permissions required to enter/confirm lineup, as well as confirming scores.  If neither captain is able to attend, refer to <a href="leaguerules"><span class="s10">League Rules for Monday Night Pinball</span></a> rule L2.01.3.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li7"><span class="s8"></span><span class="s1">M2.01.0d: The lineup shall contain a minimum of 3 rostered team members.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li9"><span class="s8"></span><span class="s1">NOTE: Roster changes must be submitted at least 24 hours prior to a match.  (see <a href="leaguerules"><span class="s10">League Rules for Monday Night Pinball</span></a>).</span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li7"><span class="s8"></span><span class="s1">M2.01.0e: Roster players not available, may be replaced by substitute players for the match.  Substitute players must meet certain requirements (see </span><span class="s5">M2.02 - Substitutions</span><span class="s1">), and team restrictions still apply.</span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s8"></span><span class="s1">M2.01.0f: A team unable to form a lineup meeting all match requirements, by 8:45pm, shall forfeit the match.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">NOTE: Teams are awarded match bonus points for having 9 or 10 players, and thus it is in every team’s best interest to find substitutes every week to fill in for missing players.  If a team is missing players, Captains are encouraged to become ambassadors for the league by recruiting new pinball enthusiasts from their host bar location and give them the opportunity to sub for one night. The match bonus points make up for the fact that they are likely not as strong as the majority of the players in the league.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">M2.02.0: Substitute players can be anyone but must meet certain constraints to be eligible to play for a team.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

  <li class="li7"><span class="s8"></span><span class="s1">M2.02.1b: if the person has played 5 or more matches with one team, that is the only team they can sub for in the 10th week or later (including the playoffs).</span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s8"></span><span class="s1">M2.02.1c: the person is not listed on the roster of any other league team.</span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s8"></span><span class="s1">M2.02.1d: the person has not already been a sub 2 times AGAINST the team they would play against.</span></li>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">M2.02.2: On any given league night, team restrictions are reconsidered for the purpose of determining if a substitute player can play for the team (see <a href="leaguerules"><span class="s10">League Rules for Monday Night Pinball</span></a> for more information). The eligibility, as it relates to Team Rating, of subs is computed as follows:         </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li7"><span class="s8"></span><span class="s1">M2.02.2a: Start with the team's current team rating. If there's a roster discrepancy, adjust the team rating to align with the actual roster.</span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s8"></span><span class="s1">M2.02.2b: Subtract the IPR of the absent team member to form the base team rating before the subs.</span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s8"></span><span class="s1">M2.02.2c: Add the IPR of the desired subs, starting with the lowest-IPR sub.         </span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s8"></span><span class="s1">M2.02.2d: If the addition of any sub would cause the Team Rating to exceed 40 (40 for 10 players, 39 for 9 players, 38 for 8 players), then the sub must have an IPR of 1. Higher rated subs are not allowed as they would cause the team to exceed it's team rating cap.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s8"></span><span class="s1">M2.02.2e: A sub with IPR=6 can only play if the team does not have another player with IPR=6 that night.        </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">M2.02.3: If an opposing captain identifies a lineup violation prior to start of the match, a different substitute must be used. If the violation is discovered after the match has begun, the substitute is permitted to play, but the team loses the match bonus points associated with having that player in the lineup. (e.g. if the lineup violation involves the 10th player, the team loses the opportunity at 5 bonus points, and match bonus points counted as having 9 legal players who all play 3 games.  See </span><span class="s5">M4.00 - Scoring</span><span class="s1"> below). Match results could be updated retroactively by the board due to use of a lineup violation from an illegal substitute.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">NOTE: The times listed above produces a timeline that has a match finish by 11:30. While there is no penalty when things take longer, we've found the enjoyment for all league players is maximized when a match doesn't drag on.

  <li class="li7"><span class="s8"></span><span class="s1">M3.00.2a: In a doubles round, the 4 games must all be on different machines.</span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s8"></span><span class="s1">M3.00.2b: In a singles round, the 7 games must all be on different machines (if 7 or more machines are available for the match).</span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s8"></span><span class="s1">M3.00.2c: If there are fewer than 7 league-worthy machines available, each machine must be used once in a singles match, and remaining games scheduled so that no machine is used more than twice during a singles round.</span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s8"></span><span class="s1">M3.00.2d: Each individual play is only allowed to play one game per round.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">M3.00.3: At the end of each game, players or their captains submit scores for each game via the MNP website software. Players should take photos of all games and upload them along with scores for review. Any score issues or loss of scorecard can be fixed with photos of the games. In the case of a player DQ or forfeit, the player should be given a score of '1', to distinguish from a '0' which causes the system to think the score is not yet entered.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">M3.00.4: At the conclusion of all games in a round, both captains should review the scores, points, and total. Once confirmed, that round is complete and cannot be changed, so make sure both sides agree before confirming.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">M3.00.6: If a machine has a catastrophic malfunction and ruling is to switch to a new machine, then the machine should be edited in the software.  Also, refer to rule </span><span class="s5">M5.02 - Additions and Exceptions to IFPA/PAPA</span><span class="s1"> for details (sepcifically M5.02.1a).</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">M4.00.0: Each match awards 82 game points. Teams can also earn up to 9 bonus points described below. If a match is tied after round 4, including bonus points, the winner of the tiebreaker gets 1 point and the win for the match. See Tiebreaker rules. Points are earned as follows:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li7"><span class="s8"></span><span class="s1">M4.00.0a: 20 points available each doubles round, as 5 points per game.</span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s8"></span><span class="s1">M4.00.0b: 21 points available each singles round, as 3 points per game.</span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s8"></span><span class="s1">M4.00.0c: <b>Match Bonus points</b> are awarded for including more players in games. Teams are awarded 9 points if they have 10 players play 3 games each, or 4 points for 9 players playing at least 3 games each.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">M4.00.1: A team that is found to have played with an illegal sub, will forfeit any match bonus points that the illegal substitute helped them obtain. For example, a team with 10 players, but one an illegal sub, will only receive 4 match bonus points due to 9 legal players. This change will be made retroactively, after the board has the opportunity to review, and make the score correction in the days following the match.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">M4.00.2: 5 points for each doubles game are scored as follows:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li7"><span class="s8"></span><span class="s1">M4.00.2a: Two players from each team play a 4 player game. The team that picked the game plays as player 1 and player 3.</span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s8"></span><span class="s1">M4.00.2b: Each player gets 1 point for each player on the other team they defeat.</span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s8"></span><span class="s1">M4.00.2c: The team with the higher combined score gets one additional bonus point.</span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s8"></span><span class="s1">M4.00.2d: Another way of saying this: Finish 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup>, win the game 5-0.</span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s8"></span><span class="s1">M4.00.2e: Finish 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup>, win the game 4-1</span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s8"></span><span class="s1">M4.00.2f: Finish 1<sup>st</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup>, then the team with higher combined score wins the game 3-2.</span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s8"></span><span class="s1">M4.00.2g: If any 2 players on opposing teams have exactly the same score at the end. They should play a 1 ball playoff with the winner adding +1 to their score. If the total is tied for the bonus point, play a 2 ball playoff as a shared singles game. Each player plays 1 ball. Add +1 to a score of one of players from the team winning the tie breaker. Do player vs player tiebreakers first, then do a bonus point tie breaker, if needed.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">M4.00.3: 3 points for each singles game are scored as follows:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li7"><span class="s8"></span><span class="s1">M4.00.3a: Win the game by less than doubling the other player's score, win the game 2-1.</span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s8"></span><span class="s1">M4.00.3b: Win the game by at least doubling the other player's score, win the game 3-0.</span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s8"></span><span class="s1">M4.00.3c: If a singles game is tied after all balls are played, there is a 1 ball playoff, with the winner getting +1 to their score. Example: Surf Champ, A vs B, 35,000 to 35,000. Playoff is 50,000 to 2,000. Report score of 35,001 to 35,000 for 2-1 points.</span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s8"></span><span class="s1">M4.00.3d: The winner of any 1 or 2 ball tie breaker will ALWAYS get ONLY +1 to their score (or at least some amount that is very small).</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">M4.00.4: At the end of the match, the team with the highest point total will be declared the winner. If the match is tied after 4 rounds, see the Tiebreaker rules below.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">M4.01.0: Each captain will have the opportunity to review all reported scores at the end of each round. If no errors are found, the round is confirmed and no longer able to be changed. There will be NO score corrections for any errors discovered after the match is confirmed and all points will be officially calculated by the software. If for any reason paper sheets are needed for a night, make sure to go through the same confirmation process as we will not alter scores. Even if incorrectly confirmed scores result in a loss for your team, the result stands.  Exception: the league may adjust match bonus points after the match, which may change results, due to illegal rosters used.</span></p>

  <li class="li7"><span class="s8"></span><span class="s1">M5.02.1e: Coaching or verbal communication to your opponent while they are playing is considered interference, and is not allowed.</span></li>
  <li class="li7"><span class="s8"></span><span class="s1">M5.02.1f: Exception to verbal communication: per IFPA rules, if there's a stuck ball during multiball, an opposing player can say "stuck ball" loud enough for the player to recognize it.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">M5.02.1: Unfortunately, not all locations have key access to every machine. In case of stuck balls during multiball on such machines, the ruling is to play on. If this leads to a situation that is clearly not fair as it leads to an exploit, then the rules for beneficial malfunction should apply. Captains should agree on a fair ruling.        </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">M5.02.2: A player who experiences a loss of ball, or is otherwise denied the opportunity to play one of their balls, by way of an <b>award to an opposing player</b>, shall be granted a compensation ball (for each ball denied).</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">NOTE: Rule M5.02.2 applies to Jersey Jack’s Pirates of the Carribean, and the “plundering” award.  However, it applies to any machine which offers a similar award.  Also see section M5.03 - Extra Balls, for applicability to the “plundered ball”.  If an opposing player is awarded with the ending of another players game, effectively denying them the opportunity to play their remaining balls, rule M5.2.02 applies.  This rule only covers loss of ball.  It does not cover any other “asset” being transferred: points, tilt warnings, locks, mode completion, etc.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">M5.02.3: Any machine awarding a Midnight Madness, or any similar experience, shall be treated as normal play.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">M5.03.0: An Extra Ball is, any ball awarded to a player, above and beyond the standard number of balls, to be played after the current ball drains (a drain usually results in an end-of-ball sequence, such as tallying bonus).  An extra ball need not be referred to as an “extra ball”; nor does the extra ball have to come immediately after the current ball drains.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">NOTE: Extra balls do not include balls such as ball-saver, virtual kickback, add-a-ball feature, or a switch counted retry - none of which trigger an end-of-ball sequence.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">M5.03.1: To help keep matches from running too long, extra balls are no longer played. Players are allowed to attempt a plunger skill shot. They may flip before launch to change a lane or make some other selection that might help. Once a ball is in motion, the player must step back from the machine with no further flips, nudges, or other button presses (like FIRE on AC/DC). The player can retry the skill shot only if the ball returns to the plunger lane and the ball is not auto-plunged upon returning. A player earns any points and end-of-ball bonus associated with plunging the extra ball.                 </span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><br>
M5.03.2: For strategic reasons, a player may choose to tilt their extra ball rather plunging it for the skill shot. To prevent confusion, the player should notify their opponents of their intent to do so, prior to intentionally tilting the ball while the ball is still in the shooter lane. Once a player attempts the skill shot, even if it returns to the plunger lane, any subsequent tilt on that ball will be a disqualification from the game.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">M5.03.3: **NEW RULE** (Exception): if a player has been awarded a compensation ball due to a major malfunction, they may choose to play an earned extra ball as the compensation, in lieu of one ball in a fresh game after the current game has ended.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">M5.03.4: In tiebreaker games, teams may play 1 extra ball, if they can get one. In 1 or 2 ball tie breakers, no extra balls are allowed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">M5.03.5: If a player forgets to plunge their extra ball and someone on the other team starts playing it, neither player is penalized. As soon as the mistake is realized, that player should drop flippers and step back, as they are inadvertently earning points for the other team. Any points earned will count to the player who earned the extra ball.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">        </span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">M5.03.6: If a player starts a normal ball that is not theirs, they forfeit the game as a zero score (to be recorded as a score of 1). If it is a doubles game, the remaining player on their team can finish the game, and still earn as many as 3 of the 5 points for the doubles game for their team.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">M5.03.7: Some machines (e.g. Space Shuttle) provide timed bonus balls. Any bonus ball that is timed and ends by disabling flippers CAN be played; these are not considered extra balls.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">M6.00.1: We are all guests of the bars that host our matches, so we must behave like guests. If a player displays unsportsmanlike conduct or threatens the safety of any individual or machine, then that player should be reported to a league official. The league will investigate the incident and, if necessary, disciplinary action will commence. Mild infractions will incur a warning, while extreme misconduct or repeated infractions will result in suspension or expulsion from the league.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">                </span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">M6.00.2: Monday Night Pinball prohibits discrimination or harassment of any kind and will strive to create a safe and fun environment for all participants. Any threats or intimidation of other players or teams will not be tolerated. Inappropriately touching another player or touching without that person's consent, whether a teammate or opponent, is considered harassment by the league.  Any league member who has experienced or witnessed harassment, discrimination, or violence toward another league member or guest, or believes a particular person, team, or location creates an unsafe environment for any reason should contact the league immediately. All league members have a responsibility to submit complaints to their captain or to the MNP board in a timely manner. The league encourages prompt reporting of all incidents, regardless of who the offender may be.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">                </span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">M6.00.3: In the event that a formal complaint is submitted to the league, an impartial investigation into the complaint will begin. This investigation will be kept confidential to the best extent possible, and will be conducted by the MNP board. Every reasonable effort will be made to rationally, objectively, and promptly resolve all complaints. At the end of the investigation period a ruling will be made by the board.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">                </span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">M6.00.4: Any league member who is found to be in violation of the code of conduct will be subject to disciplinary action as determined by the league board. This action may include suspension or expulsion from the league. Any league member who is found to have initiated a false complaint at the end of an investigation may also be subject to disciplinary action.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">                </span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">M6.00.5: The staff or management at any location has the right to evict any player from the location at any time. Should that happen, that player is disqualified from their current game if they are in the middle of a game, and cannot play in any subsequent round that night, nor can they remain on the premises. Any player that is evicted from a location,whether it be that night only or a longer period of time, will automatically incur a disciplinary review by the board. Captains are responsible for reporting such incidents to league officials within 24 hours of the incident, which should include their best assessment of what happened.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">M6.01.0: Techniques known as "Death Saves" and "Bang Backs" are not permitted during match play. However, should the drained ball bounce back into play without deliberate player action, the ball may be played. A player caught ATTEMPTING one of these techniques during match play will forfeit their score.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">                </span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">M6.01.1: </span><span class="s2">Exception</span><span class="s1">: if the machine has a post with rubber in areas after the ball drained whose purpose is to provide the player a final chance to regain the ball, then in those cases only, the player can attempt to nudge the ball when it gets to the post. Notable machines with such features include Centaur with posts in each outlane and a gate to let ball in, the right-side post on Indy Jones for narrow escape, and the center post that is close to drain on Xenon.         </span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">M7.01.0: Matches should start on time provided 8 players from each team are present. The match should not be delayed simply because a "better" player is on their way. If there are fewer than 8 players present, but more are on their way, or the captain is speaking to locals at the bar to recruit a substitute for the night, then the start of the match may be delayed for up to 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, league must move on, and games of missing players get forfeited. Team captains are encouraged to use players who are on time in Round 1, and have late arriving players only join in for Round 2.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">NOTE: No delay is permitted to allow for a 9th or 10th player to arrive.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">M7.02.0: If a team cannot field at least 7 players (including substitutes) within 15 minutes of the scheduled starting time, then they forfeit the match. The team that is present will receive the win and 41 match points (50% of 82 points) for purposes of standings. The team that forfeits receives 0 points and 0 match points. If 7 or more players from the team that is present remains at the location for at least two hours after the start time, then they will receive an additional 20 match points for a total of 61 points (~75% of 82 points). This additional reward in points is out of respect for the location owners who host the league, who may be counting on business brought in by league participation.</span></p>

TEAMS, not individuals, earn extra play.</span></p>
