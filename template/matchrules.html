If only one captain thinks a machine is not league-worthy, then the machine is &quot;in&quot; and available for selection. However, upon first occurrence of a situation that requires a major or beneficial malfunction ruling, then malfunction rules shall apply to that game, and the machine should not &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be used in subsequent rounds for the rest of the evening.

Once a player attempts the skill shot, even if it returns to the plunger lane, any subsequent tilt on that ball will be a disqualification from the game. </span></p><p class="c5 c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">M5.03.3: **NEW RULE** (Exception): if a player has been awarded a compensation ball due to a major malfunction, they may choose to play an earned extra ball as the compensation, in lieu of one ball in a fresh game after the current game has ended. </span></p><p class="c5 c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">M5.03.4: In tiebreaker games, teams may play 1 extra ball, if they can get one.
